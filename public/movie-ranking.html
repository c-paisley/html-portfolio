<h3>Notting Hill</h3>
<p>
This is a classic rom-com set in London that makes me feel cosy and at home. 
</p>
<h3>Love Actually</h3>
<p>Christmas IS all around - a film full of love, friendship and christmas magic.</p>
<h3>Wicked</h3>
<p>Had to include a musical. A new one but the songs are unbeatable!</p>
